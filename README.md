# MyMathFunctions
This is a set of math formula solvers I'm writing alongside my University's Java curriculum.

As I continue with my Computer Science curriculum, I'm keeping an eye out for some functions that Java provides by default, and re-writing them in C for practice.
I'm sure a lot of it is not the most optimal way of doing things. I plan on updating things as I go along.
